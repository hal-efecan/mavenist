The humble backpack has come a long way in terms of design and innovation over the years.
Gone are the days of wax coating bags for waterproofing - unless of course you're going for the heritage look, 
in which case brands like - Barbour/Ally Capellino, and Belstaff still make them - 
but we'll leave those for another post.

Backpacks these days tend to be over overengineered and needlessly bulky for my general usecase which is getting 
from one end of london to the other.

If you're anything like me, you appreciate simplicity, clean lines, comfort and having enough space for the 
essentials.

with this in mind i decided to handpick a selection of the finest minimal, affordable and stylish backpacks around 
today that all adhere to the principle of less is more.

## EASTPAK

Founded in 1952 Eastpak first manufactured duffels and packs for the U.S. military. 
Their bags are known for being hardwearing, and quality and innovation are at the heart of 
the brand’s design ethos.
