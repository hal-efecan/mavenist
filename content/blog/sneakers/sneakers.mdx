My philosophy when it comes to sneakers is that everyone should have a go-to core selection.
If you don’t and are buying them on the fly then you’re doing it all wrong.
There's a few considerations that should be taken when it comes to selecting your go to kicks:

<ul>
<ListItem>
    <b>Easy to acquire</b> – Non-seasonal
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
    <b>Versatility</b> - They'll need to be dressed up or pared down seamlessly. For this to work the colour palette has to be muted. stick to White/Black/Navy.
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
    <b>Form</b> - The construction and overall shape is the difference between timeless classic and the liteny of "filler" designs by sneaker brands.
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
    <b>Low cost</b> - They will be worn anywhere and everywhere so will periodically need to be refreshed without breaking the bank each time we do.
</ListItem>
<ListItem>
    <b>Function</b> - As mentioned they'll be worn anywhere & everywhere so should be comfortable at the very least.
</ListItem>
</ul>

Adidas's Stan Smiths are arguably the most popular Adidas trainer of all time.
Raf Simons has a premium version and Jay-Z name dropped them on his classic album, The Blueprint.

The Gazelle has a long history dating back to the late 60s and have been in continuous production for the last 50 years.
For me one word to describe Gazelle would be ‘memories’. They conjure images of 90s era Britpop.
The Gallagher brothers almost exclusively wore the classic 3 stripes trainers in a number of music videos;
and lets not forget David Baddiel wearing them in the Three Lions video for Euro ‘96.
Gazelles are a true icon of 90s culture.

## CONVERSE ALL STAR

Converse shoes are distinguished by a number of features, including the company's star insignia, the All Star's rubber sole, smooth rounded toe, and wrap-around stripe.
Initially developed as a basketball shoe in the early 20th century. The Chuck Taylor design has remained largely unchanged since its introduction in the 1920s. 
The shoe is made of a stitched upper portion, a toe cap that's usually made of white rubber and a rubber sole. 
Although Chuck Taylors are made of various materials such as leather, the original and most widely known version of the shoe is made from cotton canvas.
This iconic sneaker is not only famous for it's basketball roots but has also been widely adopted within the skateboarding scene.

## NIKE BLAZER MID '77

The Nike Blazer was first released in 1973 as Nike’s basketball sneaker and was named
after Oregons local basketball team, the Portland Trail Blazers.
It is the first basketball shoe to carry the Nike Swoosh.
An icon on and off the court, the Blazer is loved for its simplicity.
As basketball players left the Blazer behind, skaters took ownership of the sneaker and it found a second life that would ultimately save the silhouette from ever going out of style.

## VANS OLD SKOOL

Old Skools are most definitely summer’s most democratic shoe.
Originally purposed as a skating shoe, the Old Skools were first introduced 77', and was the first design to feature the brand’s iconic side stripe, 
which has become a signature design detail.

This style has an enduring appeal thats lasted generations. The trick is in the sneaker’s simple yet instantly recognizable design: 
a low-top shoe with leather padded heels and slick suede panelling, the style has barely changed in its history.

The black-and-white colorway prevails as the most popular design, some 40 years later.
Unlike the classic slip-on, which looks a little like an gym shoe, the Old Skool has a distinctly cooler aura about it.
