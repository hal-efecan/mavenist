In this article i'll explore just some of my favourite brands. 
Those that i think bring uniqueness in design or function.

firstly - what influenced me in writing this article in the first place was my fascination for 
japanese style. Not all brands listed below are japanese but they follow in a similar ilk.

This deep rooted fascination goes back to when i first 
watched the intro scene to Rockstar's cult classic GTA2 back in '99. 
I rememeber like it was yesterday playing it on my packard bell PC that took up 90% of my
precious desk space and GTA2 for the time equivalent in days playing the game.

It was the Yakuza that caught my eye with their full body koi fish tattoos.
The 12 year old me was captivated to say the least.

I never did manage to pluck up the courage and get a full body tattoo myself... 
But where i lacked the the body art i made up for in the wardrobe department.

To kick things off i want to begin with my favourite eyewear brand that i believe epitomizes 
what for me is japanese cool - not to mention craftsmanship.

### Native Sons (Japan)

My first purchase from the guys at NS was the Roy.
it's elegntly designed understated and checks all the boxes for me when it comes to proportions.
It has a smaller shape by design with a narrow bridge making it suitable for those with smaller faces.

### Wacko Maria (Japan)

The next brand on my list is wacko maria. first appearing on the scene back in '05. What i go to WM
for is their HAWAIIAN SHIRTs. you simply cannot beat the prints. they're 
simply a masterclass in design - the visual equivelent to red velvet cake.

### Cote et ciel (France)

when it comes to bags the first thing that any utilitarian shopper should look for is form & function, 
and CEC have this in... well bags. CEC have been doing their thing since '08. 
When it comes to innovative designs that seemlessly bridge the gap between fashion and industral design 
then there's simply no better candidate.

### Veilance (Canada)

Another one of my favourite brands that flies under the radar for most is the Veilance line by the canadian
outerwear brand Arcteryx. 
what Veilance does best is creating hybrid pieces that bridge the gap between
classical mens tailored silhouettes and brings them into the 21st century with modern materials 
and construction. weather it's using man made materials such as goretex who's natural habitat is on 
climbers on cliff edges. 
Having the seems sealed make the garmets fully water proof - keeping you both dry and looking good
when running to the grocery store in the urban ecosystem that is our city.

### VisVim (Japan)

And finally we come to VisVim
focused on sourcing premium textiles which are then expertly crafted by blind nuns on the sidesteps of the himalayans.. 
well not quite ... but you get the idea.
littered throughout collections are almost suggestive Navaho inspired touches such as the signature finged suede boots.

VisVim for me is what RL tried but ultimately failed to achieve with Double RL. And that's saying something 
given the war chest that is usually accompanied by a RL sub-brand.
