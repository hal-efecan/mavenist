I'd like to say that my career has been a fulfilling one - but it's hard to find fulfillment
in dressing the obnoxiously rich for a living.

I've worked in a variety of roles and businesses in luxury over the past decade.

I would like to think that this bredth of experience has taught me a thing or two which allows me to speak 
to what i know to be true. 

i've gone from retail to wholesale and back again. 
my career has been spent between soho and mayfair.
From london to paris to milan and everything in between.

from humble beginings of selling denim on the shop floor 
to buying brands for a luxury department store
to running the commerial product of arguably the most recognisable global retailing juggernaut
i've helped develope the architecture of seasonal collections for a british heritage brand
to buying 20K diamond encrusted suits for a global "fashion house"

theres a continual debate that's been going on in fashion circles since the beggining of time 

- is fashion an art or a business?

the short answer is - it's a bit of both.

which is what makes fashion all the more interesting. If you're interested in pretty things then your interest
is likely to have peaked - If on the other hand you're interested in underlying consumer behaviour
and to gain a deeper understanding of what sparks a trends (and ultimately kill them) then read on.

what comes first the chicken or the egg?  

The  industry employs hundereds of thousands of people  along the supply chain 
which can only be sustained through profitable operations.

the problem arises when commercial considerations start to outweigh the need to be original.
As a purist and someone who likes to believe in the art of fashion.

i feel that fashion has strayed far along the spectrum and is mostly about commercial success rather than 
creative.

- i find words a hard medium to explain the feeling of putting on crisp new suit or fresh pair of sneakers.
- instagram i feel has dumbed down fashion to the extent that most never really get a true understanding of what fashion really is.
- what emotions does a picture really invoke other than - "that looks nice" or "thats cool"?
- this i belive has contributed to fashion losing it's very essense
- images i find are part of the problem when it comes to product. They capture a moment but not the feeling.
this is where words take on meaning to transport the buyer into who i am and what i find value in.

- the typical luxury fashion customer tends to buy, not out of nessecity but out of compulsion, bordom and 
arguably addiction.
- when you see the delivery of you're new package at your front door you inevitably get a hit of endorphins
that elevats your relief.
fashion is simply a manifestation of the human condition.
- value is something that i look for. something i will be alot of use from in these times of fast fashion

If anyone tries to convince you otherwise - they're either young and just starting out or old and make money
from the peddling the illusion of art from the covers of the glossy magazines selling a dream to those
hungry to have it. 

It almost always begins as art but soon after the tentacles of capitalism begin to suffocate the creativity.

its a constant struggle - trying to drive change and create newness while at the same time making sure 
that you don't alientate your existing cleintelle.

a perfect case study would be that of Brioni 2017. 

as much as i know the tools used to market a lifestyle brand i still cannot resist buying more.
