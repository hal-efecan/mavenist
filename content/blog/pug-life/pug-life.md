Firstly if you thought this article was about pugs then im sorry to dissapoint.
I stumbled upon this bad boy and it just spoke to me on many levels.
Maybe it the was the vacant look in his eyes that reminded me of sitting in design reviews
or the equally painful monday meetings.

What ever it was - it epitomized what it feels like to work in the emotionally draining but 
ultimatly fun world of fashion.

There's a continual debate that's been going on in fashion circles since the begining of time (almost).

Is fashion an art or a business? The short answer - A bit of both

I'm arguing that the pace at which we now consume fashion has brought us to the point where creativity has simply become forced.

***It's like talking to that one friend for the 10th time this week - there comes a point where you simply have nothing
more to say.***

Cue those blood sucking souls in the marketing that almost float in the room like 
Dracula reincarnated tasked with finding a new way to spin the humble flannel pant.
As much as i love to hate the the marketing process it's what makes fashion all the more interesting.
Ultimately it's what works in creating the aura of desirability 

*But at what cost?... well, creativity.*

For instance when was the last time you saw something truly original from the brands with the biggest marketing budgets?

You guessed it - hardly ever. The big brands are big not because of their creativity but simply because of their 
cash cows sold en masses to their cohort of loyal as well as aspiring new clients - just think ponies and polos.

I've worked in a variety of roles in luxury and retail over the past decade.

The majority of my career has been spent in Soho & Mayfair square mile -
travelling between London, Paris, Milan and everything in between.

I've gone from retail to wholesale and back again.
I've run the commerial product of arguably the most recognisable brand in the world, and
developed collections for iconic British heritage brands.
I've even bought jewel encrusted tailoring for a fashion house that would give Liberace a run for his money.

If my experiences have taught me anything it's that business always trumps art. 

<!-- My experiences have taught me a great deal in terms of fashion but also
consumer behaviour/psychology and trends in general. -->

Fashion used to be the main mediums to express yourself through times of cultural and social change. Think mods, rockers, skinheads and punks of the 60s/70s.

These days your typical fashion customer tends to buy, not out of a necessity for social expression but rather compulsion, bordom and even addiction.
I know i certainly fit into this category. 

What does that say about the state of fashion?  

<!-- Think Supreme and the resale culture or H&M with their cookie cutter t-shirts for $10. -->

<!-- when we look back at the naughties and teens i think we'll define this age of fashion 
as a time of excess with some minor flashes or true creativity. -->
