If there's one thing that we're all guilty of lately, it's lounging.
i for one have felt like i've been in an abyss of state sanctioned nothingness ever since big brother
advised us not leave our homes.

I dont even know what day it is - monday? wednesday? sunday? does it even matter? 

this morning,
like most mornings this past month i start my day by prepping my black filter or as i like to call it - wake up juice

morning brew in hand i start my migration
like a lone wildebeast navigating through the masai mara
in search of the preverbial green pasture that is my sofa -

instead of a lion i have to carefully shuffle past my cat 
while she relentlessly attacks my anckles.

this mornings entertainment - Naked Gun.
half way through 
i get to the scene where Frank the inept 
police detective says - "do you mind if i slip into something a little more comfortable" 
Queue the comical misdirection - Frank goes off and comes back with a dapper sartorial ensemble that 
would give Donald Draper a run for his money. 

this leads me to think about the state of my own comfort. looking down at todays mismatch - 
A Charlie Brown t-shirt that reads "Charlie don't surf" (in ref to Coppola's brilliant - Apocolypse Now) 
paired with a light grey sweatpant from Asos.

i can't help but think it's about time i upped my lounge game & got myself a "grown up" pair of PJs.

I havent owned a pair in a while. Come to think the last time i owned a set was when i was 11.
black, yellow and red - Lion King set with a prominent Simba print on the front.
A strong look even back then.

i always wanted to "graduate" from pyjamas as a child
and what better time than when i started secondary school. I subbed the PJs for a t-shirt/short combo and
that was that.

fast forward 20 years and here i am full circle, on the hunt for PJs. 

heres a shortlist of PJ's that's caught my attention.
