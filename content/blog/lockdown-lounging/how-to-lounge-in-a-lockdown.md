If there's one thing that we're all guilty of lately, it's lounging.
I for one have felt like i've been in a state sanctioned blackhole ever since we were advised not to leave our homes.

I dont even know what day it is - monday? wednesday? Does time even exist in the fourth dimesion?

This morning, like most mornings this month i started my day by prepping my filter.
Brew in hand i begin my migration - a lone wildebeast navigating through the masai mara in search of the preverbial green pasture of my sofa.

This mornings entertainment - the Leslie Neilsen classic, Naked Gun.
Half way through i get to the scene where Frank the inept 
police detective says - "Do you mind if i slip into something a little more comfortable" 
Queue the comical misdirection - Frank goes off and comes back with a dapper sartorial ensemble that 
would give Don Draper a run for his money. 

This inevitably leads me to think about the state of my own comfort. looking down at todays mismatch - 
A Charlie Brown t-shirt that reads "Charlie don't surf" (in ref to Coppola's brilliant - Apocolypse Now) 
paired with a light grey sweatpant.

I can't help but think it's about time i upped my loungwear game & got myself a "grown up" pair of PJs.

I havent owned a pair in a while. Come to think the last time i owned a set was when i was 11. A Lion King set with a prominent Simba print on the front.

Fast forward 20 years and here i am full circle, back on the hunt for PJs. Here's a shortlist of PJ's on the market that caught my attention.
