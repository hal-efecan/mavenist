The guys from the brilliance inspired me to create *The Mavenist*.
Founded and written by Benjamin Edgar, Chuck Anderson and the Virgil Abloh.
This rough around the edges blog started in the early days of the internet before it was cool & 
introduced me to many ideas before fashion oritented digital publishing was even a thing.

## Bachronym

Next up is a fashion kindred spirit of mine - I dont know too much about Jonathan other than the fact that he has a cool look and a penchant for Acronym
among others.

## Benjjii

Last up we have Benjji - this chap has a rediculous collection of sneakers that make you blue with envy.
All photos are expertly put together.
