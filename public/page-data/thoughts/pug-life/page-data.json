The short answer - A bit of both</p>\n<p>I’m arguing that the pace at which we now consume fashion has brought us to the point where creativity has simply become forced.</p>\n<p><strong><em>It’s like talking to that one friend for the 10th time this week - there comes a point where you simply have nothing\nmore to say.</em></strong></p>\n<p>Cue those blood sucking souls in the marketing that almost float in the room like\nDracula reincarnated tasked with finding a new way to spin the humble flannel pant.\nAs much as i love to hate the the marketing process it’s what makes fashion all the more interesting.\nUltimately it’s what works in creating the aura of desirability </p>\n<p><em>But at what cost?… well, creativity.</em></p>\n<p>For instance when was the last time you saw something truly original from the brands with the biggest marketing budgets?</p>\n<p>You guessed it - hardly ever. The big brands are big not because of their creativity but simply because of their\ncash cows sold en masses to their cohort of loyal as well as aspiring new clients - just think ponies and polos.</p>\n<hr>\n<div class=\"container\">\n<iframe style=\"width:120px;height:240px;\" marginwidth=\"0\" marginheight=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" frameborder=\"0\" src=\"//ws-eu.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?ServiceVersion=20070822&OneJS=1&Operation=GetAdHtml&MarketPlace=GB&source=ac&ref=tf_til&ad_type=product_link&tracking_id=themavenist-21&marketplace=amazon&region=GB&placement=B014KPLT9Q&asins=B014KPLT9Q&linkId=0ca9d1ac31e7b4a3adef000b65e931ef&show_border=true&link_opens_in_new_window=true&price_color=333333&title_color=0066c0&bg_color=ffffff\">\n</iframe>\n</div>\n<p>I’ve worked in a variety of roles in luxury and retail over the past decade.</p>\n<p>The majority of my career has been spent in Soho &#x26; Mayfair square mile -\ntravelling between London, Paris, Milan and everything in between.</p>\n<p>I’ve gone from retail to wholesale and back again.\nI’ve run the commerial product of arguably the most recognisable brand in the world, and\ndeveloped collections for iconic British heritage brands.\nI’ve even bought jewel encrusted tailoring for a fashion house that would give Liberace a run for his money.</p>\n<p>If my experiences have taught me anything it’s that business always trumps art. </p>\n<!-- My experiences have taught me a great deal in terms of fashion but also\nconsumer behaviour/psychology and trends in general. -->\n<p>Fashion used to be the main mediums to express yourself through times of cultural and social change. Think mods, rockers, skinheads and punks of the 60s/70s.</p>\n<p>These days your typical fashion customer tends to buy, not out of a necessity for social expression but rather compulsion, bordom and even addiction.\nI know i certainly fit into this category. </p>\n<p>What does that say about the state of fashion?  </p>\n<!-- Think Supreme and the resale culture or H&M with their cookie cutter t-shirts for $10. -->\n<!-- when we look back at the naughties and teens i think we'll define this age of fashion \nas a time of excess with some minor flashes or true creativity. -->"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"pug-life"}}}
