If you’re interested in pretty things then your interest\nis likely to have peaked - If on the other hand you’re interested in underlying consumer behaviour\nand to gain a deeper understanding of what sparks a trends (and ultimately kill them) then read on.</p>\n<p>what comes first the chicken or the egg?  </p>\n<p>The  industry employs hundereds of thousands of people  along the supply chain\nwhich can only be sustained through profitable operations.</p>\n<p>the problem arises when commercial considerations start to outweigh the need to be original.\nAs a purist and someone who likes to believe in the art of fashion.</p>\n<p>i feel that fashion has strayed far along the spectrum and is mostly about commercial success rather than\ncreative.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>i find words a hard medium to explain the feeling of putting on crisp new suit or fresh pair of sneakers.</li>\n<li>instagram i feel has dumbed down fashion to the extent that most never really get a true understanding of what fashion really is.</li>\n<li>what emotions does a picture really invoke other than - “that looks nice” or “thats cool”?</li>\n<li>this i belive has contributed to fashion losing it’s very essense</li>\n<li>images i find are part of the problem when it comes to product. They capture a moment but not the feeling.\nthis is where words take on meaning to transport the buyer into who i am and what i find value in.</li>\n<li>the typical luxury fashion customer tends to buy, not out of nessecity but out of compulsion, bordom and\narguably addiction.</li>\n<li>when you see the delivery of you’re new package at your front door you inevitably get a hit of endorphins\nthat elevats your relief.\nfashion is simply a manifestation of the human condition.</li>\n<li>value is something that i look for. something i will be alot of use from in these times of fast fashion</li>\n</ul>\n<p>If anyone tries to convince you otherwise - they’re either young and just starting out or old and make money\nfrom the peddling the illusion of art from the covers of the glossy magazines selling a dream to those\nhungry to have it. </p>\n<p>It almost always begins as art but soon after the tentacles of capitalism begin to suffocate the creativity.</p>\n<p>its a constant struggle - trying to drive change and create newness while at the same time making sure\nthat you don’t alientate your existing cleintelle.</p>\n<p>a perfect case study would be that of Brioni 2017. </p>\n<p>as much as i know the tools used to market a lifestyle brand i still cannot resist buying more.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"pug-life"}}}
