The big brands are big not because of their creativity but simply because of their\ncash cows sold en masses to their cohort of loyal as well as aspiring new clients </p>\n<ul>\n<li>think ponies and polos.</li>\n</ul>\n<hr>\n<p>i’ve worked in a variety of roles in luxury over the past decade.</p>\n<p>for the majority of my career i’ve been based between soho and mayfair.\ntravelled from london to paris, milan and everything in between.\nGone from retail to wholesale and back again.\nrun the commerial product of arguably the most recognisable brand in the world.\nDeveloped seasonal collections for storied british heritage brands\n&#x26; bought jewel encrusted suits for a fashion house that would give Liberace a run for his money.</p>\n<p>I’d hope that my experiences have taught me a thing or two over the years - both in terms of fashion but also\nconsumer behaviour/psychology and trends.</p>\n<p>traditionally fashion has been the medium to express ones self through times of cultural and social change.\nthink mods, rockers, skinheads and punks of the 60s/70s.</p>\n<p>Now the typical customer tends to buy, not out of nessecity or but out of compulsion bordom and addiction </p>\n<ul>\n<li>think Supreme and the resale culture surrounding it or H&#x26;M with their cookie cutter t-shirts for $10.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>when we look back at the naughties and teens i think we’ll define this age of fashion\nas a time of excess with some minor flashes or true creativity.</p>"}},"pageContext":{"slug":"pug-life"}}}
